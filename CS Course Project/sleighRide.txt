ust hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo!" (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
