Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
Frank Sinatra
1950
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dyin'
And my dear, we're still goodbyin'
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
He doesn't care if it's ten below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow (let it snow!)
Ooh-wee, goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm?
His girl by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, let it snow, let it snow (I don't care!)
The weather outside is frightful
But that fire, umm, delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought lots of corn for poppin'
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow (let it snow!)
When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dyin'
And my dear, we're still goodbyin'
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
