Jingle Bells
Dean Martin
1966
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob tailed nag
Two forty for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh and
Crack you'll take the lead
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Oh Jingle bells and jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh yeah
Come on Prancer and Dancer
Go on, get out of here
